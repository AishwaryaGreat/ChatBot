## QA Bot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Interface

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot, utilizing Pinecone DB for vector storage and the Cohere API for generative responses. Additionally, it features an interactive frontend built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on their content.

## Part 1: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model

### Problem Statement
Develop a RAG-based model to handle questions related to a provided document or dataset, using Pinecone DB for storing and retrieving document embeddings efficiently.

### Task Requirements
1. **Implement a RAG-based model**: Utilize Pinecone DB and Cohere API.
2. **Store document embeddings**: Efficiently use Pinecone DB.
3. **Test the model**: Ensure it retrieves relevant information and generates coherent answers.

### Deliverables
- **Colab Notebook**: Demonstrates the entire pipeline, from data loading to question answering.
- **Documentation**: Explains the model architecture, retrieval approach, and generative response creation.
- **Example Queries**: Showcases the model's capabilities.

## Part 2: Interactive QA Bot Interface

### Problem Statement
Develop an interactive interface allowing users to upload documents and ask questions based on the content of the uploaded document.

### Task Requirements
1. **Frontend Interface**: Use Streamlit for the user interface.
2. **Backend Integration**: Process PDF, store document embeddings, and provide real-time answers.
3. **Handle Multiple Queries**: Efficiently provide accurate, contextually relevant responses.
4. **Display Retrieved Segments**: Show the retrieved document segments alongside generated answers.

### Deliverables
- **Deployed QA Bot**: Frontend interface with document upload and interaction capabilities.
- **Documentation**: Guides users on uploading files, asking questions, and viewing responses.
- **Example Interactions**: Demonstrates the bot's functionality.

## General Guidelines
1. **Modular and Scalable Code**: Follow best practices for both frontend and backend development.
2. **Thorough Documentation**: Explain your approach, decisions, challenges, and solutions.
3. **Detailed ReadMe File**: Include setup and usage instructions.
4. **Comprehensive Submissions**:
    - Source code for both the notebook and the interface.
    - Fully functional Colab notebook.
    - Documentation on the pipeline and deployment instructions.

## Example Interactions
- **Query**: What are pathogens?
- **Response**: Pathogens are organisms that cause disease. They can be viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms.
